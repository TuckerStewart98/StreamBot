A bot created for Discord in collaboration with Dv8FromTheWorld's JDA API(https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) as a dependencies for this MAVEN project. When a user on a Discord server that StreamBot is on starts streaming, StreamBot will send a message to all servers that user and StreamBot are members of, notifying all users on those servers that the user is has started streaming and post a link to streaming user's streaming service. For StreamBot to be able to detect when a user has started streaming, the user needs to have their streaming service (Twitch or Youtube) connected to their Discord account.
